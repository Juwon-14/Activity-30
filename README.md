The TextBox class includes a constructor to set the initial value, a setValue function to change the value, a getValue function to retrieve the value, and a display function to print the current value. In the main function, a TextBox object is created with the initial value "This is the CIS 25 class", then the value is changed to "I'm Juwon Hong" and printed to verify the program's operation.
